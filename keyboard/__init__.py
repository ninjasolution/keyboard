keyboard
========

Take full control of your keyboard with this small Python library. Hook global events, register hotkeys, simulate key presses and much more.

## Features

- **Global event hook** on all keyboards (captures keys regardless of focus).
- **Listen** and **send** keyboard events.
- Works with **Windows** and **Linux** (requires sudo), with experimental **OS X** support (thanks @glitchassassin!).
- **Pure Python**, no C modules to be compiled.
- **Zero dependencies**. Trivial to install and deploy, just copy the files.
- **Python 2 and 3**.
- Complex hotkey support (e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+M, Ctrl+Space`) with controllable timeout.
- Includes **high level API** (e.g. [record](#keyboard.record) and [play](#keyboard.play), [add_abbreviation](#keyboard.add_abbreviation)).
- Maps keys as they actually are in your layout, with **full internationalization support** (e.g. `Ctrl+รง`).
- Events automatically captured in separate thread, doesn't block main program.
- Tested and documented.
- Doesn't break accented dead keys (I'm looking at you, pyHook).
- Mouse support available via project [mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) (`pip install mouse`).

## Usage

Install the [PyPI package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyboard/):

    $ sudo pip install keyboard

or clone the repository (no installation required, source files are sufficient):

    $ git clone https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard

Then check the [API docs](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#api) to see what features are available.


## Example


```
import keyboard

keyboard.press_and_release('shift+s, space')

keyboard.write('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.')

# Press PAGE UP then PAGE DOWN to type "foobar".
keyboard.add_hotkey('page up, page down', lambda: keyboard.write('foobar'))

# Blocks until you press esc.
keyboard.wait('esc')

# Record events until 'esc' is pressed.
recorded = keyboard.record(until='esc')
# Then replay back at three times the speed.
keyboard.play(recorded, speed_factor=3)

# Type @@ then press space to replace with abbreviation.
keyboard.add_abbreviation('@@', 'my.long.email@example.com')
# Block forever.
keyboard.wait()
```

## Known limitations:

- Events generated under Windows don't report device id (`event.device == None`). [#21](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/21)
- Media keys on Linux may appear nameless (scan-code only) or not at all. [#20](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/20)
- Key suppression/blocking only available on Windows. [#22](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/22)
- To avoid depending on X ,the Linux parts reads raw device files (`/dev/input/input*`)
but this requries root.
- Other applications, such as some games, may register hooks that swallow all 
key events. In this case `keyboard` will be unable to report events.
- This program makes no attempt to hide itself, so don't use it for keyloggers or online gaming bots. Be responsible.

        This function is called for every OS keyboard event and decides if the
        event should be blocked or not, and passes a copy of the event to
        other, non-blocking, listeners.

        There are two ways to block events: killing keys, which behaves as if
        the key was not present, by suppressing all its events; and blocked
        shortcuts, which suppress specific key combinations.

        Properly blocking all key combos requires time travel: if "a+b" is
        blocked, accepting or not "a" depends if it'll be followed by "b".
        Things get hairer with multi-steps, timeouts, multiple blocks, keys
        held between presses, etc. So we don't. Only modifiers+key are
        accepted.

        This is possible because modifiers fall into two categories:
        - `ctrl` and `shift` usually have no effect on their own.
        - `alt` and `windows` have actions by themselves, but only when
        released.
        So we allow `ctrl` and `shift`, in case they are being used by a game
        or similar, and suppress key presses of `alt` and `windows`, faking a
        key press when they are released by themselves.
